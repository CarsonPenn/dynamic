        description: 'Organzied from the already successful British mission in 1845. The First president of the mission was Dan Jones a legendary missionary known for his boldness in sharing his testimony of the Restored Gospel. Dan grew up in Wales and later left to sail the sea as a mariner. Dan Later moved to America and worked as a steamboat captain on the Mississippi river, this is where he was exposed to the church. He was baptised in 1843 and went to Carthage Jail with the prophet Joseph Smith in the summer of 1844. Dan was not afraid to die for his beliefs but Joseph prophesied that Dan would yet see Wales again as a missionary, this came true several months later as Dan and his wife Jane left for Wales. The offical Welsh mission was later absolved back into the British mission due to widespread opposition, and significant emigration to the United States.',

        description: 'On a cold December day while Joseph Smith was in Kirtland Ohio, the problem he faced was an unending tidal wave of persecution for the saints in Missouri who had been forcibly driven from their homes after peacefully trying to establish homes. In this section the Lord counsels that His followers must be chastened at times like Abraham once was when commanded to offer up his only son. The Lord speaks peace to His people saying that " all they who have mourned shall be comforted." (v.14). The Lord further comforts His people in verse 16; "Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God." That promise is well known throughout the church and has been a comfort to members all across the globe. ',
